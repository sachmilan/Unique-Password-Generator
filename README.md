## Features

You can create a password, which belongs to only and only you. To add more security, we included a questionary in the application, in which you can choose whether you want upper case, lower case, numbers, and special charaters in there. To give you even more security, you can even choose the lenght of your unique password, as it gives you the option to have the length of the password from 8 characters all the way to 128 characters.

## How to contribute

You can always look at the HTML code and the CSS styling which I use. I trust myself completely; however, not a single man on this earth is perfect, so if you find a better way to code the password generator or find any fault in my code, feel free to contact me on Linkedin, Github and Gmail, all you have to do is to search my name- Sachmilan Singh.
